# PricePared – a price comparison application 
The aim of this project is to overcome the issue of comparing prices of products sold by different retail stores situated at customer’s city. This application allows users to filter and compare products based on price, features, reviews and other criteria, with 'add to cart' and 'Offline Pick-Up and Payments' functionalities.
